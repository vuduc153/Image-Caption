# Image Caption
## About
Inspired by Microsoft's CaptionBot project: 

https://www.captionbot.ai/

Here we try to replicate the results with a shallow LSTM network and a much smaller dataset for experimenting purpose. The obtained results were not perfect but quite acceptable considering that the computational power required is exponentially lower.

## Dataset

+ Flickr8k dataset (8.000 images)

Much larger datasets are also available for further improvement:

+ Flicker30k dataset (30.000 images)

+ Microsoft's Coco dataset (180.000 images)

## Deployment

A web app for a quick demonstration of the result is available at:
